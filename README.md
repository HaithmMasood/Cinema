# Cinema Ticketing System

## Description
This project is a Java-based cinema ticketing system. It allows users to visualize seating arrangements in a cinema, calculate total potential income from ticket sales, reserve seats, and view cinema statistics. The system is designed to provide a simple yet functional interface for managing a small to medium-sized cinema.

## Features
- **Seating Arrangement Visualization**: Display rows and seats in a grid format.
- **Dynamic Ticket Pricing**: Calculates ticket prices based on seat location and total number of seats.
- **Interactive Menu**: Provides options to show seats, buy tickets, view statistics, and exit the program.
- **Statistics**: Shows the number of purchased tickets, percentage occupancy, current income, and total income.
- **Error Handling**: Prevents the purchase of already sold tickets and validates user input.
